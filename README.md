## Introduction
This repo contains my notes and official documents related to my Bachelor Project. This project is being done in USI Lugano under the guidance of Professor Landoni Monica. 
## Project Proposal
My Bachelor Project Title is **"Investigating Information Pollution and Hallucinations in Childrenâ€™s Online Search Behavior"**. The objective of this project is to investigate and classify the occurrences of information pollution and hallucinations in children's online search behavior. The project aims to analyze search results retrieved from Google APIs and compare them with responses generated from conversational AI models like ChatGPT. By doing so, the project seeks to identify and classify the information pollution and hallucination patterns in children's online search behavior and propose possible solutions to mitigate them. The project also aims to investigate whether ChatGPT yields more pertinent outcomes compared to conventional methods of browsing, such as using Google.
